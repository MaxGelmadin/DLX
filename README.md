# DLX
 Just a little side project as a CS student. I want to implement a little Sudoku game, so in order to do it efficiently
 I chose to use this algorithm that made by Donald Knuth.
 As a little practice I implemented it and later on Sudoku game and solver will be added.
 Implementation of Donald Knuth's Algorithm-X
